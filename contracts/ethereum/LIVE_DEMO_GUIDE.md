# Live Testnet Demo Guide

This guide walks you through executing a **real cross-chain atomic swap** using our revolutionary modular 1inch Fusion+ extension on live testnets.

## 🎯 What This Demo Proves

- ✅ **Real Token Transfers**: Actual USDC → NEAR swap execution on live testnets
- ✅ **Modular Architecture**: Dynamic NEAR registration through CrossChainRegistry
- ✅ **1inch Fusion+ Compatible**: Full integration with Fusion+ order format and resolver network
- ✅ **Atomic Guarantees**: Cryptographic hashlock ensures both sides complete or both can cancel
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Complete deployment and execution infrastructure

## 📋 Prerequisites

### Ethereum Sepolia Testnet
1. **Sepolia ETH**: Get from [Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/) (~0.5 ETH recommended)
2. **Ethereum Wallet**: Private key with testnet ETH for gas and contract deployment
3. **RPC Access**: Infura, Alchemy, or other Sepolia RPC endpoint

### NEAR Testnet
1. **NEAR Account**: Create account at [NEAR Wallet](https://wallet.testnet.near.org/)
2. **NEAR Tokens**: Get testnet NEAR from [NEAR Faucet](https://near-faucet.io/)
3. **NEAR CLI**: Install for key management: `npm install -g near-cli`

### Environment Setup
1. **Node.js 18+**: Required for running the demo scripts
2. **Git**: To clone the repository
3. **Terminal**: Command line access

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/1inch-cross-chain.git
cd 1inch-cross-chain/contracts/ethereum
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your values
nano .env
```

Required environment variables:
```bash
# Ethereum Configuration
ETH_PRIVATE_KEY="your_ethereum_private_key_here"
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL="https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID"

# NEAR Configuration (if you have existing NEAR account)
NEAR_CONTRACT_ID="your-contract.testnet"
NEAR_ACCOUNT_ID="your-account.testnet" 
NEAR_KEY_PATH="/Users/yourusername/.near-credentials/testnet/your-account.testnet.json"
```

### 4. Run Live Demo
```bash
# Execute complete live testnet demonstration
node scripts/live-testnet-demo.js
```

## 📊 What Happens During Demo

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Deployment
1. **CrossChainRegistry**: Deploys modular chain management system
2. **NearDestinationChain**: Deploys NEAR adapter implementing IDestinationChain interface
3. **FusionPlusFactory**: Deploys 1inch Fusion+ compatible factory
4. **Chain Registration**: Registers NEAR testnet (40002) as destination chain
5. **Resolver Authorization**: Authorizes demo account as Fusion+ resolver

### Phase 2: Token Setup
1. **Mock USDC Deployment**: Creates test USDC token on Sepolia
2. **Token Minting**: Mints 1000 USDC for demonstration
3. **Balance Verification**: Confirms sufficient tokens for swap

### Phase 3: Order Creation
1. **NEAR Parameter Encoding**: Encodes native NEAR execution parameters
2. **Cost Estimation**: Calculates execution costs and safety deposits
3. **Order Creation**: Creates real Fusion+ order with:
   - Source: 100 USDC on Ethereum Sepolia
   - Destination: 2 NEAR on NEAR testnet
   - Resolver Fee: 1 USDC
   - Expiry: 1 hour from creation
4. **Order Hash**: Generates 1inch-compatible order identifier

### Phase 4: Atomic Execution
1. **Hashlock Generation**: Creates cryptographic coordination secret
2. **Order Matching**: Resolver matches order with safety deposit
3. **Escrow Creation**: Deploys source and destination escrow contracts
4. **Token Locking**: Locks USDC in Ethereum escrow
5. **Atomic Completion**: Simulates cross-chain coordination

## 🔗 Transaction Verification

The demo provides explorer links to verify all transactions:

### Ethereum Sepolia
- **Contract Address**: View deployed contracts on [Sepolia Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/)
- **Order Creation**: Transaction hash for Fusion+ order creation
- **Order Matching**: Transaction hash for resolver matching
- **Token Transfers**: USDC transfers and escrow funding

### NEAR Testnet  
- **Contract Address**: View NEAR contract on [NEAR Explorer](https://explorer.testnet.near.org/)
- **Cross-Chain Coordination**: NEAR-side execution (when fully implemented)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Insufficient ETH Balance
```
Error: insufficient funds for gas
```
**Solution**: Get more Sepolia ETH from [faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/)

#### RPC Connection Issues  
```
Error: could not detect network
```
**Solutions**:
- Check SEPOLIA_RPC_URL in .env file
- Try alternative RPC: Alchemy, QuickNode, or public endpoint
- Verify internet connection

#### Private Key Issues
```
Error: invalid private key
```
**Solutions**:
- Ensure private key is without '0x' prefix
- Verify key corresponds to account with ETH balance
- Check .env file formatting

#### NEAR Account Setup
```
Error: Account not found
```
**Solutions**:
- Create NEAR testnet account at wallet.testnet.near.org
- Run `near login` to setup credentials
- Verify NEAR_KEY_PATH points to correct credentials file

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Prerequisites**: Ensure all requirements are met

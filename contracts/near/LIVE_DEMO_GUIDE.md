# Live Demo Guide: ETH→NEAR Atomic Swap

This guide walks through executing a real cross-chain atomic swap between Ethereum Sepolia and NEAR testnet with actual token transfers.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Accounts & Tokens
- **Ethereum Sepolia**: Account with ETH and USDC tokens
- **NEAR Testnet**: Account with NEAR tokens (minimum 3 NEAR recommended)
- **Private Keys**: Access to both accounts for transaction signing

### 2. Environment Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your credentials
nano .env
```

### 3. Required Balances
- **Ethereum**: ~0.1 ETH for gas, 10+ USDC for swap
- **NEAR**: ~3 NEAR total (2 for swap + 0.1 resolver fee + gas)

## Demo Execution

### Option 1: Automated Script
```bash
# Run complete ETH→NEAR demo
npm run demo:eth-to-near
```

### Option 2: Manual Steps

#### Step 1: Initialize Demo
```bash
node -e "
const { LiveEthToNearDemo } = require('./live-demo-eth-to-near.js');
const demo = new LiveEthToNearDemo();
demo.initialize().then(() => console.log('Demo initialized'));
"
```

#### Step 2: Create Ethereum Intent
```bash
# Creates intent on Sepolia with real USDC
# Locks 10 USDC for 2 NEAR swap
```

#### Step 3: Create NEAR HTLC Order
```bash
# Locks 2 NEAR on testnet
# Matches Ethereum intent parameters
# Same hashlock for atomic coordination
```

#### Step 4: Resolver Matching
```bash
# Resolver commits with safety deposit
# 10% of swap amount (0.2 NEAR)
# Ready for atomic execution
```

#### Step 5: Atomic Completion
```bash
# Preimage revealed on NEAR
# Resolver claims 2 NEAR + 0.1 NEAR fee
# Ethereum side can now be claimed (future enhancement)
```

## Expected Results

### Successful Execution
✅ **Ethereum Intent**: Created with transaction hash  
✅ **NEAR Order**: Locked with explorer link  
✅ **Order Matching**: Resolver committed  
✅ **Atomic Claim**: Preimage revealed, funds transferred  

### Transaction Evidence
- **Ethereum Sepolia**: Intent creation transaction
- **NEAR Testnet**: Order creation, matching, and claim transactions
- **Explorer Links**: All transactions viewable on block explorers

### Token Transfers
- **USDC**: Locked in Ethereum factory contract
- **NEAR**: Transferred from maker to resolver atomically
- **Fees**: Resolver receives 0.1 NEAR fee for service

## Demo Architecture

```
Ethereum Sepolia                    NEAR Testnet
================                    =============

1. Create Intent                    2. Create HTLC Order
   ├─ Lock 10 USDC                     ├─ Lock 2 NEAR  
   ├─ Set hashlock: H(preimage)        ├─ Same hashlock
   └─ Timelock: 1000 blocks            └─ Timelock: 1000 blocks

3. [Future] Match Intent            4. Match Order  
   ├─ Resolver commits                 ├─ Resolver commits
   └─ Safety deposit                   └─ 0.2 NEAR deposit

5. [Future] Claim with preimage     6. Claim with preimage
   ├─ Reveal preimage                  ├─ Reveal preimage  
   └─ Transfer USDC                    └─ Transfer 2.1 NEAR
```

## Security Model

### Atomic Guarantees
- **Same Hashlock**: Both chains use identical SHA-256 hash
- **Coordinated Timeouts**: Sufficient time for completion
- **Preimage Revelation**: Secret shared atomically

### Safety Mechanisms
- **Resolver Deposits**: Economic incentive for honest behavior
- **Timeout Protection**: Orders can be cancelled if expired
- **Hash Verification**: Cryptographic proof required for claims

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Insufficient Balance**: Ensure adequate tokens on both chains
2. **RPC Timeouts**: Use reliable RPC endpoints (Infura, Alchemy)
3. **Gas Estimation**: Allow extra gas for complex transactions
4. **NEAR Credentials**: Verify key file exists and permissions

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable verbose logging
DEBUG=* npm run demo:eth-to-near
```

### Manual Verification
```bash
# Check Ethereum intent status
# Check NEAR order status
near call cross-chain-htlc.demo.cuteharbor3573.testnet get_order '{"order_id": "ORDER_ID"}' --accountId demo.cuteharbor3573.testnet
```

## Bounty Compliance

This demo satisfies the critical bounty requirement:

> **"Onchain (mainnet or testnet) execution of token transfers should be presented during the final demo"**

✅ **Real Testnets**: Ethereum Sepolia + NEAR testnet  
✅ **Actual Tokens**: USDC and NEAR token transfers  
✅ **Live Execution**: All transactions on public blockchains  
✅ **Verifiable**: Explorer links for all transactions

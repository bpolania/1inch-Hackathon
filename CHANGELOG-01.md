#### üîß **CRITICAL FIXES FOR AUTOMATED EXECUTION**
- **Event Detection Resolution**: Fixed executor-client to properly detect new orders
  - **ABI Correction**: Updated FusionOrderCreated event ABI from 4 to 11 parameters
  - **Event Parameter Mapping**: Correctly mapped all order parameters from blockchain events
  - **Block Monitoring**: Fixed periodic scanning for missed events with proper parameter extraction
- **Order Data Integrity**: Resolved order corruption issues causing execution failures
  - **Contract ABI Alignment**: Updated getOrder ABI to match 12-field FusionPlusOrder struct
  - **Data Type Consistency**: Fixed struct field mismatches between contract and executor expectations
  - **Hashlock Propagation**: Ensured hashlock properly captured from events and propagated through execution
- **Safety Deposit Management**: Implemented protective measures against astronomical deposit calculations
  - **Deposit Caps**: Applied 0.1 ETH maximum and 0.01 ETH minimum safety deposit limits
  - **Amount Validation**: Added source amount scaling detection and correction logic
  - **Balance Protection**: Prevented executor from attempting impossible deposit amounts

#### üí∞ **PROFIT GENERATION AND PERFORMANCE**
- **Successful Atomic Swap Execution**: Complete cross-chain transaction with profit
  - **Source Amount**: 0.5 DT tokens successfully swapped
  - **Resolver Fee**: 0.05 DT tokens (10% fee) collected as profit
  - **Safety Deposit**: 0.01 ETH used (reasonable amount within caps)
  - **Gas Efficiency**: Optimized transaction costs for maximum profitability
- **Transaction Chain Completion**: All phases of atomic swap executed successfully
  - **Order Matching**: Ethereum order matched with proper hashlock coordination
  - **Cross-Chain Execution**: NEAR side execution with token delivery
  - **Secret Revelation**: Hashlock unlocked with proper secret propagation
  - **Token Settlement**: Source tokens transferred to escrow completing the swap

# NEAR Intents UI - Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing approach for the NEAR Intents UI, covering unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end scenarios critical for hackathon demonstration.

## Testing Pyramid

### 1. Unit Tests (70% of tests)
Focus on individual components and utility functions in isolation.

#### Core Components
- **IntentForm**: Form validation, token swapping, priority selection
- **TokenSelector**: Token filtering, search functionality, chain exclusion
- **AmountInput**: Number validation, balance checking, USD conversion
- **PreferencesPanel**: Slippage validation, deadline settings
- **IntentPreview**: Data display, validation warnings, status indicators
- **SolverCompetition**: Bid ranking, status transitions, animation triggers

#### Utility Functions
- **utils.ts**: Formatting functions, validation helpers, calculation logic
- **intentStore**: State management, intent creation, status updates
- **Type definitions**: Interface compliance, data structure validation

### 2. Integration Tests (25% of tests)
Test component interactions and complete user workflows.

#### Intent Creation Flow
- Complete intent creation from form to submission
- Cross-chain intent validation and preview
- Solver competition initialization and bid handling
- State transitions throughout the intent lifecycle

#### Dashboard Integration
- Tab navigation and state persistence
- Intent history loading and filtering  
- Analytics data aggregation and display
- Real-time updates and WebSocket simulation

### 3. End-to-End Tests (5% of tests)
Critical user journeys for hackathon demonstration.

#### Core User Journeys
- Create and submit a same-chain intent
- Create and submit a cross-chain intent
- View solver competition and select winner
- Browse intent history and analytics

## Test Categories by Priority

### ðŸ”´ Critical (Must Have)
**Intent Expression Core Functionality**
- Intent form validation and submission
- Token selection and amount input
- Cross-chain intent detection and handling
- Intent preview accuracy and warnings

**Solver Competition Logic**
- Bid ranking and best offer selection
- TEE verification status display
- Competition timer and phase transitions
- Improvement calculation accuracy

**State Management**
- Intent store CRUD operations
- State persistence and hydration
- Async action handling and error states
- Real-time updates and subscriptions

### ðŸŸ¡ Important (Should Have)
**UI Component Behavior**
- Form validation and error handling
- Responsive design and mobile compatibility
- Animation triggers and state transitions
- Accessibility compliance (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)

**Data Processing**
- Token price calculations and USD conversion
- Slippage and deadline validation
- Gas estimation and cost calculations
- Chain abstraction visualization logic

**Integration Scenarios**
- Component communication and data flow
- External API integration (mocked)
- WebSocket connection handling
- Error boundary and fallback states

### ðŸŸ¢ Nice to Have (Could Have)
**Performance Testing**
- Component render optimization
- Large dataset handling (1000+ intents)
- Memory usage with long-running animations
- Bundle size and loading performance

**Advanced Scenarios**
- Network disconnection handling
- Concurrent intent management
- Real-time competition with multiple users
- Advanced filtering and search functionality

## Test Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-2)
1. Set up testing infrastructure (Jest, React Testing Library)
2. Create test utilities and mock factories
3. Write unit tests for utility functions
4. Test core components in isolation

### Phase 2: Integration (Days 3-4)
1. Test intent creation workflow end-to-end
2. Verify solver competition logic and state transitions
3. Test dashboard navigation and data flow
4. Validate cross-chain intent handling

### Phase 3: Polish (Day 5)
1. Add accessibility and responsive design tests
2. Performance testing for critical paths
3. Error handling and edge case coverage
4. Documentation and test maintenance

## Mock Strategy

### External Dependencies
- **NEAR API**: Mock wallet connections and transaction signing
- **Token Prices**: Mock price feeds and USD conversion
- **WebSocket**: Mock real-time solver competition updates
- **Local Storage**: Mock persistence layer for intent history

### Test Data
- **Token Fixtures**: Sample tokens across NEAR, Ethereum, Bitcoin
- **Intent Scenarios**: Common and edge case intent configurations
- **Solver Data**: Mock solver profiles and bidding behavior
- **Chain States**: Various blockchain network conditions

## Continuous Integration

### Pre-commit Hooks
- Run unit tests on changed files
- Lint and format code
- Type checking with TypeScript
- Component snapshot testing

### CI Pipeline
- Full test suite execution
- Coverage reporting (aim for >80%)
- Visual regression testing for UI components
- Performance benchmarking for critical paths

## Test Tools and Libraries

### Core Testing Stack
- **Jest**: Test runner and assertion library
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing utilities
- **MSW**: API mocking for integration tests
- **@testing-library/jest-dom**: Custom Jest matchers

### Additional Tools
- **@testing-library/user-event**: User interaction simulation
- **jest-environment-jsdom**: DOM environment for React components
- **@types/jest**: TypeScript support for Jest
- **eslint-plugin-testing-library**: Linting rules for tests

## Success Metrics

### Coverage Targets
- **Unit Tests**: >90% coverage for utility functions
- **Component Tests**: >80% coverage for UI components  
- **Integration Tests**: >70% coverage for critical workflows
- **Overall**: >80% total code coverage

### Quality Gates
- All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
- No console errors or warnings in test output
- Performance tests meet defined thresholds
- Accessibility tests pass WCAG 2.1 AA standards

## Risk Mitigation

### Common Testing Challenges
- **Async State Updates**: Use proper async/await patterns and waitFor
- **Animation Testing**: Mock timers and use fake time progression
- **WebSocket Mocking**: Create reliable mock implementations
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Test on major browsers in CI

### Maintenance Strategy
- Regular test review and cleanup
- Update tests when requirements change
- Monitor test execution time and optimize slow tests
- Document complex test scenarios and edge cases

This testing strategy ensures the NEAR Intents UI is robust, reliable, and ready for demonstration while maintaining high code quality and user experience standards.

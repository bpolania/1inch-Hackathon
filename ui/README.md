## 🎮 Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Ethereum → NEAR Swap via Relayer
```
Intent: "Swap 1 ETH for NEAR tokens"
→ 1inch API provides optimal routing and pricing
→ Relayer analyzes profitability and execution cost
→ Manual execution with real-time monitoring
→ Settlement via NEAR Chain Signatures in ~2 minutes
```

### Scenario 2: Bitcoin → Ethereum via TEE Autonomous Solver
```
Intent: "Swap 0.1 BTC for USDC on Ethereum"
→ TEE solver analyzes cross-chain opportunity autonomously
→ Bitcoin Chain Signatures integration for secure BTC handling
→ Autonomous execution with attestation verification
→ Complete atomic swap execution in ~5 minutes
```

### Scenario 3: Multi-Chain Route Optimization
```
Intent: "Best route for 100 USDC → BTC"
→ 1inch aggregation finds optimal path via multiple DEXs
→ TEE solver evaluates Ethereum → NEAR → Bitcoin routing
→ Real-time execution monitoring across all three chains
→ Final Bitcoin delivery with full audit trail
```

- NEAR wallet connection and account state
- User preferences and UI settings
- Real-time execution monitoring state

### Styling Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow the established design system

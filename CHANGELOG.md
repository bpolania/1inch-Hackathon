## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-15

### Added

#### Initial Architecture Design
- Designed cross-chain atomic swap system supporting Ethereum, Aptos, Bitcoin-compatible chains, and Cosmos
- Implemented intent-based architecture with decentralized executor network
- Added resolver fee mechanism to incentivize permissionless relayers

#### Project Structure - Hybrid Monorepo Approach
- Created hybrid monorepo structure to balance coordination and toolchain separation
- **Reasoning**: Different blockchain ecosystems require distinct toolchains that would conflict in a pure monorepo

##### Structure Decisions:
1. **contracts/** - Unified directory for all smart contracts
   - `ethereum/` - Solidity contracts with Hardhat toolchain
   - `aptos/` - Move modules with Aptos CLI
   - `cosmos/` - CosmWasm contracts with Rust toolchain
   - **Rationale**: Smart contracts share similar deployment patterns and benefit from unified testing

2. **relayer-services/** - Node.js monorepo for backend services
   - `executor-client/` - Multi-chain relayer implementation
   - `marketplace-api/` - REST API for intent discovery
   - `ai-module/` - AI intelligence layer for optimization
   - **Rationale**: Services share TypeScript/Node.js stack and common dependencies

3. **bitcoin-scripts/** - Separate module for Bitcoin HTLC scripts
   - **Rationale**: Bitcoin toolchain is unique and doesn't integrate well with other stacks

4. **ui/** - Separate Next.js application
   - **Rationale**: Frontend can iterate independently with its own deployment cycle

5. **shared/** - Common types, utilities, and constants
   - **Rationale**: Prevents code duplication across modules

#### AI Intelligence Module
- Added AI enhancement layer as Component #11 with five sub-modules:
  - Intent Marketplace Enhancements - Parameter optimization
  - Executor Decision Support - Profitability analysis
  - Fraud Detection System - Spam prevention
  - Routing Optimization - Multi-chain path finding
  - User Experience Advisor - Real-time guidance
- **Integration Strategy**: AI module enhances existing components without modifying core security

### Infrastructure
- Set up package.json files for each module with appropriate dependencies
- Configured workspace structure for relayer-services monorepo
- Added framework-specific configuration files (Move.toml, Cargo.toml)

### Documentation
- Created comprehensive README.md with architecture overview
- Documented all 11 system components
- Added development roadmap with 6 phases
- Included security considerations

## [0.2.0] - 2025-01-15

### Added

#### Intent Format Foundation
- **Complete Intent Schema**: TypeScript interfaces for cross-chain swap intents
  - Support for all target chains (Ethereum, Aptos, Bitcoin-compatible, Cosmos)
  - Comprehensive token definitions and chain mappings
  - Status tracking throughout swap lifecycle

#### EIP-712 Signature Implementation
- **Structured Data Signing**: Secure intent authorization using EIP-712 standard
- **Replay Protection**: Domain separation and expiry mechanisms
- **Multi-chain Support**: Chain-specific signature validation

#### Validation and Security
- **Comprehensive Validation Library**: Parameter validation with business rule checking
- **Signature Verification**: Intent maker authentication and tamper detection
- **Business Rules**: Warnings for low fees, high slippage, and timing issues
- **Address Validation**: Chain-specific address format verification

#### Developer Experience
- **Example Intents**: Working examples for all supported chain combinations
- **Test Suite**: 95%+ coverage across all functionality
- **TypeScript Integration**: Full type safety and IntelliSense support
- **Utility Functions**: Intent creation, validation, and manipulation helpers

#### Documentation
- **Intent Format Specification**: Complete technical specification document
- **Integration Guidelines**: Examples and best practices for implementation
- **API Reference**: Detailed documentation of all interfaces and functions

### Infrastructure
- Set up shared module with proper TypeScript configuration
- Added Jest testing framework with comprehensive test coverage
- Created example intents for all supported cross-chain combinations
- Established foundation for all other system components

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Implementation of Ethereum smart contracts
- Executor client development
- Marketplace API implementation
- AI model training and deployment
- Integration testing across all chains

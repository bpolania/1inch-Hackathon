## [0.8.0] - 2025-07-24

### üîç **ARCHITECTURAL REALIZATION**: Understanding True 1inch Fusion+ Extension Requirements

#### üéØ **Critical Discovery**
- **Research Completed**: Deep analysis of actual 1inch Fusion+ architecture and contracts
- **Extension Mechanism**: Discovered 160-bit extension hash in order `salt` field for chain-specific data
- **ITakerInteraction Interface**: Identified key interface that resolvers must implement for custom logic
- **Limit Order Protocol V4**: Found the base extensible order system that Fusion+ builds upon

#### üìö **Documentation of True Architecture**
- **Added Comprehensive Section**: New "TRUE 1inch Fusion+ Extension Architecture" in README
- **Order Structure Analysis**: Documented actual 1inch order format and key interfaces
- **Extension Pattern**: Outlined proper way to extend Fusion+ without replacing core contracts
- **NEAR Integration Blueprint**: Provided concrete code examples for proper NEAR extension

#### üö® **Current Implementation Assessment**
- **Architectural Gap Identified**: Current implementation is "Fusion+-inspired" not true extension
- **Parallel System Issue**: Built separate factory/registry instead of extending 1inch contracts
- **Integration Missing**: No use of actual 1inch order format or settlement contracts
- **Decision Point**: Documented options for refactoring vs. presenting current work

#### üßπ **Housekeeping**
- **Removed Outdated Docs**: Deleted SEPOLIA-DEPLOYMENT.md and LIVE_DEMO_GUIDE.md (based on incorrect architecture)

- **Test Coverage**: Maintained 100% pass rate (106/106 tests) for current implementation

#### ü§î **Next Steps Decision Required**
- **Option 1**: Refactor completely to true 1inch extension (significant work, proper bounty qualification)
- **Option 2**: Present current sophisticated work as-is (may not qualify for bounty)
- **Option 3**: Build minimal true extension as proof-of-concept (quick validation)

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-15

### Added

#### Initial Architecture Design
- Designed cross-chain atomic swap system supporting Ethereum, Aptos, Bitcoin-compatible chains, and Cosmos
- Implemented intent-based architecture with decentralized executor network
- Added resolver fee mechanism to incentivize permissionless relayers

#### Project Structure - Hybrid Monorepo Approach
- Created hybrid monorepo structure to balance coordination and toolchain separation
- **Reasoning**: Different blockchain ecosystems require distinct toolchains that would conflict in a pure monorepo

##### Structure Decisions:
1. **contracts/** - Unified directory for all smart contracts
   - `ethereum/` - Solidity contracts with Hardhat toolchain
   - `aptos/` - Move modules with Aptos CLI
   - `cosmos/` - CosmWasm contracts with Rust toolchain
   - **Rationale**: Smart contracts share similar deployment patterns and benefit from unified testing

2. **relayer-services/** - Node.js monorepo for backend services
   - `executor-client/` - Multi-chain relayer implementation
   - `marketplace-api/` - REST API for intent discovery
   - `ai-module/` - AI intelligence layer for optimization
   - **Rationale**: Services share TypeScript/Node.js stack and common dependencies

3. **bitcoin-scripts/** - Separate module for Bitcoin HTLC scripts
   - **Rationale**: Bitcoin toolchain is unique and doesn't integrate well with other stacks

4. **ui/** - Separate Next.js application
   - **Rationale**: Frontend can iterate independently with its own deployment cycle

5. **shared/** - Common types, utilities, and constants
   - **Rationale**: Prevents code duplication across modules

#### AI Intelligence Module
- Added AI enhancement layer as Component #11 with five sub-modules:
  - Intent Marketplace Enhancements - Parameter optimization
  - Executor Decision Support - Profitability analysis
  - Fraud Detection System - Spam prevention
  - Routing Optimization - Multi-chain path finding
  - User Experience Advisor - Real-time guidance
- **Integration Strategy**: AI module enhances existing components without modifying core security

### Infrastructure
- Set up package.json files for each module with appropriate dependencies
- Configured workspace structure for relayer-services monorepo
- Added framework-specific configuration files (Move.toml, Cargo.toml)

### Documentation
- Created comprehensive README.md with architecture overview
- Documented all 11 system components
- Added development roadmap with 6 phases
- Included security considerations
